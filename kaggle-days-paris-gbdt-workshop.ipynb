However, they seldom perform the best out-of-the-box (using default values) because of the many hyper-parameters to tune. Especially in the most recent GBDT implementations, such as LightGBM, the over-sophistication of hyper-parameters renders finding the optimal settings by hand or simple grid search difficult because of high combinatorial complexity and long running times for experiments. \n\n[Random Optimization](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization-of-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf) (BERGSTRA, James; BENGIO, Yoshua.

Packt Publishing Ltd, 3rd ed., 2018\n\n### Gradient Tree Boosting\n\nGradient Tree boosting or Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) is another improved version of boosting (fitting a sequence of weak learners on reweighted versions of the data). Like AdaBoost, GBDT is based on a gradient descent function. The algorithm has proven to be one of the most proficient ones from the ensemble, though it is characterized by an increased variance of estimates, more sensibility to noise in data (both problems could be attenuated by using sub-sampling), and significant computational costs due to nonparallel operations.\n\nApart from deep learning, gradient boosting is actually the most developed machine learning algorithm. Since Adaboost and the following Gradient Boosting implementation as developed by Jerome Friedman, there appeared various implementations of the algorithms, the most recent ones being XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost\n\n### LightGbm\nThe high-performance [LightGBM](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM) algorithm is capable of being distributed and of fast-handling large amounts of data. It has been developed by a team at Microsoft as an open source project on GitHub (there is also an [academic paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficientgradient-boosting-decision-tree)). \n\nLightGBM is based on decision trees, as well as XGBoost, yet it follows a different strategy.\nWhereas XGBoost uses decision trees to split on a variable and exploring different cuts at that variable (the level-wise tree growth strategy), LightGBM concentrates on a split and goes on splitting from there in order to achieve a better fitting (this is the leaf-wise tree\ngrowth strategy). This allows LightGBM to reach first and fast a good fit of the data, and to generate alternative solutions compared to XGBoost (which is good, if you expect to blend, i.e. average, the two solutions together in order to reduce the variance of the estimated). Algorithmically talking, figuring out as a graph the structures of cuts operated by a decision tree, XGBoost peruses a breadth-first search (BFS), whereas LightGBM a depthfirst search (DFS).\n\nTuning LightGBM may appear daunting with more than a [hundred parameters](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Parameters.rst) (also to be found [here](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html)) to tune.\n\n### XGBoost\n\n[XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/XGBoost) stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting, an open source project that is not part of Scikit-learn, though recently it has been expanded by a Scikit-Learn wrapper interface that renders using models based on XGBoost more integrated into your data pipeline.\n\nThe XGBoost algorithm has gained recently gained momentum and popularity in datascience competitions such as Kaggle and the KDD-cup 2015. As the authors (Tianqui Chen, Tong He, and Carlos Guestrin) report on papers they wrote on the algorithm, among 29 challenges held on Kaggle during 2015, 17 winning solutions used XGBoost as a standalone solution or as part of an ensemble of multiple different models.\n\nApart from the successful performances in both accuracy and computational efficiency, XGBoost is also a scalable solution under different points of view. XGBoost represents a new generation of GBM algorithms thanks to important tweaks to the initial tree boost GBM algorithm:\n\n* A sparse-aware algorithm; it can leverage sparse matrices, saving both memory (no need for dense matrices) and computation time (zero values are handled in a special way).\n* Approximate tree learning (weighted quantile sketch), which bears similar results but in much less time than the classical complete explorations of possible branch cuts.\n* Parallel computing on a single machine (using multi-threading in the phase of the search for the best split) and similarly distributed computations on multiple ones. \n* Out-of-core computations on a single machine leveraging a data storage solution called Column Block. This arranges data on a disk by columns, thus saving time by pulling data from the disk as the optimization algorithm (which works on column vectors) expects it.\n* XGBoost can also deal with missing data in an effective way. Other tree ensembles based on standard decision trees require missing data first to be imputed using an off-scale value, such as a negative number, in order to develop an appropriate branching of the tree to deal with missing values.\n\nAs for as XGBoost's [parameters](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html), we have decided to work on a few key ones you will find across competitions and projects.\n\n### CatBoost\nIn July 2017, another interesting GBM algorithm was made public by Yandex, the Russian search engine: it is [CatBoost](https://catboost.yandex/), whose name comes from putting together the two words Category and Boosting. In fact, its strongest point is the capability of handling categorical variables, which actually make the most of information in most relational databases, by adopting a mixed strategy of one-hot-encoding and mean encoding (a way to express categorical levels by assigning them an appropriate numeric value for the problem at hand; more on that later).\n\nThe idea used by CatBoost to encode the categorical variables is not new, but it has been a kind of feature engineering used various times, mostly in data science competitions like at Kaggle’s. Mean encoding, also known as likelihood encoding, impact coding, or target coding, is simply a way to transform your labels into a number based on their association with the target variable. If you have a regression, you could transform labels based on the mean target value typical of that level; if it is a classification, it is simply the probability of classification of your target given that label (probability of your target, conditional on each category value). It may appear as a simple and smart feature engineering trick, but actually, it has side effects, mostly in terms of overfitting because you are taking information from the target into your predictors.\n\nCatBoost has quite a few [parameters](https://tech.yandex.com/catboost/doc/dg/concepts/python-reference_parameters-list-docpage/#python-reference_parameters-list), we have delimited our search to the 9 most important ones."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a5394d535544fc4a2a01a6c2ede769f721d29d4d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"MAX_ROUNDS = 2000\nlgb_iter1 = []\nsklearn_gbm_iter1 = []\nxgb_gbm_iter1 = []\n\nlgb_ap1 = []\nsklearn_gbm_ap1 = []\nxgb_gbm_ap1 = []","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"20d1632795df886c35ecb555481ad7100e5b0649"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set up the classifier with standard configuration\n# Later we will more performing parameters with Bayesian Optimization\nparams = {\n    'learning_rate':  0.06, \n    'max_depth': 6, \n    #'lambda_l1': 16.7,\n    'min_data_in_leaf':5,\n    'boosting': 'gbdt', \n    'objective': 'binary', \n    'metric': 'auc',\n    'feature_fraction': .9,\n    'is_training_metric': False, \n    'seed': 1\n}","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"cbb21d50c19443cc0233d94b773d4ac31bc580bf"},"cell_type":"code","source":"for i, (train_index, test_index) in enumerate(skf.split(train,y_bin)):\n    \n    #

Based on that surrogate function it exploits an initial approximate knowledge of how the predictor works in order to sample more useful examples and minimize the cost function at a global level, not a local one.\n\nAs the Bayesian part of the title suggests, we use priors in order to make smarter decisions about sampling during optimizing in order to reach a minimization faster by limiting the number of evaluations we need to make.\n\nBayesian Optimization uses an acquisition function to tell us how promising an observation will be.\nIn fact, to rule the tradeoff between exploration and exploitation, the algorithm defines an acquisition function that provides a single measure of how useful it would be to try any given point.\n\nFrom the figure taken from [Skopt API documentation](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/notebooks/bayesian-optimization.html), you can figure out that the surrogate function (the green dotted line, whose error band is represented by the light green area) has somehow approximated the true cost function (the red dotted line):\n\n![figure_1](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/notebooks/bayesian-optimization_files/bayesian-optimization_21_0.png)\n\nThe observations supporting the construction of the surrogate function are not randomly sparse around, because, through an acquisition function (in a gaussian processes it is a function guiding the selection of the next evaluation points), they have been picked as the most useful examples in order to guess how to minimize the cost function.\n\nIn respect of a random optimization, a bayesian optimization is more of an educated guess, then, first sampling randomly, but then focussing on the most important combination of hyper-parameters in order to figure out, first the surrogate function of the cost function, then the global minimum of the cost function:\n\n![figure_2](https://scikit-optimize.github.io/notebooks/bayesian-optimization_files/bayesian-optimization_18_1.png)\n\nGaussian process (GP) is one of the possible ways to build a surrogate function: it consists of a distribution on functions.\nOriginally GPs were developed to help search for gold ([kriging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kriging)). Please note that the approach is closely related to the statistical ideas in the optimal design of experiments.\nIn a gaussian process, based on a distribution of functions resembling the true cost function, the alogorithm operates in:\n\n* Exploration -> seeking points and areas on the optimization surface with high variance\n* Exploitation -> seeking points with low mean\n\nThis is done by a second, specialized function, the acquisition function.\n\nOther approaches are 1) ensembles of decision trees 2) Tree of Parzen Estimators (TPE used by [Hyperopt](http://hyperopt.github.io/hyperopt/) \nanother Bayesian optimization package package) \n\nGaussian Processes are just models, and they're much more like k-nearest neighbors and linear regression than may at first be apparent.

This allows LightGBM to reach first and fast a good fit of the data, and to generate alternative solutions compared to XGBoost (which is good, if you expect to blend, i.e. average, the two solutions together in order to reduce the variance of the estimated).

As the authors (Tianqui Chen, Tong He, and Carlos Guestrin) report on papers they wrote on the algorithm, among 29 challenges held on Kaggle during 2015, 17 winning solutions used XGBoost as a standalone solution or as part of an ensemble of multiple different models.\n\nApart from the successful performances in both accuracy and computational efficiency, XGBoost is also a scalable solution under different points of view. XGBoost represents a new generation of GBM algorithms thanks to important tweaks to the initial tree boost GBM algorithm:\n\n* A sparse-aware algorithm; it can leverage sparse matrices, saving both memory (no need for dense matrices) and computation time (zero values are handled in a special way).\n* Approximate tree learning (weighted quantile sketch), which bears similar results but in much less time than the classical complete explorations of possible branch cuts.\n* Parallel computing on a single machine (using multi-threading in the phase of the search for the best split) and similarly distributed computations on multiple ones. \n* Out-of-core computations on a single machine leveraging a data storage solution called Column Block. This arranges data on a disk by columns, thus saving time by pulling data from the disk as the optimization algorithm (which works on column vectors) expects it.\n* XGBoost can also deal with missing data in an effective way. Other tree ensembles based on standard decision trees require missing data first to be imputed using an off-scale value, such as a negative number, in order to develop an appropriate branching of the tree to deal with missing values.\n\nAs for as XGBoost's [parameters](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/parameter.html), we have decided to work on 13 key ones.

In fact, its strongest point is the capability of handling categorical variables, which actually make the most of information in most relational databases, by adopting a mixed strategy of one-hot-encoding and mean encoding (a way to express categorical levels by assigning them an appropriate numeric value for the problem at hand; more on that later).\n\nThe idea used by CatBoost to encode the categorical variables is not new, but it has been a kind of feature engineering used various times, mostly in data science competitions like at Kaggle’s. Mean encoding, also known as likelihood encoding, impact coding, or target coding, is simply a way to transform your labels into a number based on their association with the target variable. If you have a regression, you could transform labels based on the mean target value typical of that level; if it is a classification, it is simply the probability of classification of your target given that label (probability of your target, conditional on each category value). It may appear as a simple and smart feature engineering trick, but actually, it has side effects, mostly in terms of overfitting because you are taking information from the target into your predictors.\n\nCatBoost has quite a few [parameters](https://tech.yandex.com/catboost/doc/dg/concepts/python-reference_parameters-list-docpage/#python-reference_parameters-list), we have delimited our search to the 9 most important ones.
